webserver:
  # Sets the host and port.
  # Port 80 is the default port for web servers and might be blocked on your maschine.
  # If that is the case you can use anything else like 8080 for example.
  # 0.0.0.0 exposes accweb on the internet.
  host: 0.0.0.0:80

  # Set tls to true and provide paths to the key files in order to enable SSL.
  # This is highly recommended as otherwise your passwords and all other traffic won't be encrypted!
  # accweb will probably support automatic Letsencrypt certificates in the future.
