webserver:
  # Sets the host and port.
  # Port 80 is the default port for web servers and might be blocked on your maschine.
  # If that is the case you can use anything else like 8080 for example.
  host: $ACCWEB_HOST
  
  # Set tls to true and provide paths to the key files in order to enable SSL.
  # This is highly recommended as otherwise your passwords and all other traffic won't be encrypted!
  # accweb will probably support automatic Letsencrypt certificates in the future.

  # Optional path to public and private token key files. If you need to store the private/public keys used to
  # sign the session token (the JWT) in a specific location (or have existing keys in a specific location), you
  # can define those here.

  # accweb now generate these with a default path if not configured.

  # Path to ACC server installation directory.
  # Use forward slashes (even if you're on Windows!). The example path is for Linux.
